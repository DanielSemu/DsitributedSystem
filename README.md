# DistributedSystem
The project, the use of a RESTful web service architecture makes it a distributed system. A RESTful web service is a client-server architecture that enables communication between multiple machines over a network. The server provides a set of web services that can be accessed by clients over the network. These web services typically allow clients to perform operations on the server such as querying or updating data.

In a distributed system using a RESTful web service architecture, the client and server may run on different machines, which can be geographically distributed. The communication between the client and server occurs over a network, which introduces latency, and requires mechanisms for ensuring reliability and fault-tolerance. The server typically needs to handle a large number of concurrent requests from multiple clients and scale out horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic.

In the context of the ticket booking system project, a RESTful web service can be used to implement the booking service API. Clients can access this API over the network to perform operations such as booking a ticket or querying the available seats. The server can be designed to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients and scale out horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic. The use of a distributed architecture in this way allows the ticket booking system to be more resilient, scalable and accessible from multiple locations, which is the hallmark of a distributed system.
